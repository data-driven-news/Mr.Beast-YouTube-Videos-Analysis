# Classifying Mr. Beast YouTube Videos

## Project Description
This project aims to classify Mr. Beast's YouTube videos into specific categories based on their content. The categories used in this analysis are:
- **Giving out cash**
- **Vs Challenges**
- **Challenges**
- **Survival**
- **Experiments**
- **Giveaways**
- **Contests**
- **Other**

By analyzing the titles and descriptions of the videos, we seek to understand the distribution of content types and their performance metrics, such as view counts, like counts and comment counts.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Loading**: Loaded the dataset containing Mr. Beast's YouTube videos, including titles, descriptions and performance metrics.
2. **Data Exploration**: Explored the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the titles and descriptions to prepare them for classification, including removing special characters and extra spaces.
4. **Classification Logic**: Developed a classification function to categorize the videos based on keywords found in the titles and descriptions.
5. **Performance Analysis**: Analyzed the average performance metrics (view counts, like counts, and comment counts) for each category.
6. **Visualization**: Created visualizations to illustrate the distribution of videos across categories and their average performance metrics.

## Findings and Conclusions
- **Category Distribution**: The `Other` category dominates the classification, indicating a broad range of content. Following this, `Survival` and `Challenges` categories are also significant.
- **View Count Performance**: `Vs Challenge` videos have the highest average view counts, suggesting strong viewer interest. The `Other` category ranks second, followed by `Survival`, indicating diverse content that attracts attention.
- **Overall Performance**: All categories show a healthy level of performance in terms of views. However, engagement metrics such as likes and comments are relatively low across all categories.
- **Engagement Insights**: Low likes and comments may suggest viewers prefer passive consumption rather than active engagement with the content.
- **Trends and Recommendations**: Focus on creating more content in the popular categories (`Vs Challenge` and `Survival`) and enhance audience interaction to boost engagement metrics.

This project highlights Mr. Beast's effective content strategy and the need for ongoing analysis of audience engagement to refine future content strategies.
